# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring the existing form components in the Budgeteer application to follow React and React Native best practices, improve code maintainability, fix potential bugs, and establish consistent patterns across all forms. The current forms include AccountCategoryForm, AccountForm, ConfigurationForm, MultipleTransactions, TransactionCategoryForm, TransactionForm, and TransactionGroupForm.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent form patterns across all components, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing form components THEN all forms SHALL follow the same structural patterns for state management, validation, and submission
2. WHEN examining form props THEN all forms SHALL use consistent prop interfaces and naming conventions
3. WHEN looking at form initialization THEN all forms SHALL handle initial state and prop updates in the same manner
4. WHEN checking form exports THEN all forms SHALL export types and initial states consistently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and loading states, so that users receive appropriate feedback during form operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a form submission fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
2. WHEN a form is loading data THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators consistently across all forms
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and highlight validation errors
4. WHEN network requests are pending THEN the system SHALL disable form controls to prevent duplicate submissions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved type safety and validation, so that runtime errors are minimized and data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining form data types THEN all forms SHALL use strict TypeScript interfaces with proper null/undefined handling
2. WHEN validating form inputs THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive client-side validation
3. WHEN handling form field changes THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety throughout the data flow
4. WHEN processing form submissions THEN the system SHALL validate data before sending to the backend

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable form components and hooks, so that code duplication is eliminated and maintenance is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing form logic THEN common patterns SHALL be extracted into reusable custom hooks
2. WHEN creating form fields THEN shared field components SHALL be used consistently across all forms
3. WHEN handling form state THEN a common form state management pattern SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN processing form submissions THEN shared submission logic SHALL be abstracted into reusable utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper accessibility and user experience patterns, so that forms are usable by all users and provide good UX.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with forms THEN all form fields SHALL have proper labels and accessibility attributes
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be announced to screen readers
3. WHEN forms are submitted THEN users SHALL receive clear feedback about the operation status
4. WHEN forms have complex interactions THEN keyboard navigation SHALL work properly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized performance and memory usage, so that forms render efficiently and don't cause memory leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forms re-render THEN unnecessary re-renders SHALL be prevented through proper memoization
2. WHEN components unmount THEN all subscriptions and timers SHALL be properly cleaned up
3. WHEN handling large datasets THEN forms SHALL implement efficient data handling patterns
4. WHEN forms have complex state THEN state updates SHALL be optimized to prevent performance issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent styling and responsive design, so that forms work well across different screen sizes and maintain visual consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing forms on different devices THEN all forms SHALL be responsive and maintain usability
2. WHEN comparing form layouts THEN all forms SHALL follow consistent spacing and styling patterns
3. WHEN forms contain complex layouts THEN they SHALL adapt properly to web and mobile platforms
4. WHEN forms display validation states THEN visual feedback SHALL be consistent across all components
